## Project Overview

The **5G Energy Consumption Base Model** project focuses on analyzing and predicting the energy consumption patterns of **5G networks**. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the model aims to forecast power consumption based on a range of factors including base station data, network load, and more. This can help network operators and energy providers optimize energy usage and reduce operational costs. 

The project is built using Python and implemented in a Google Colab notebook environment, utilizing several machine learning models for the task of energy consumption prediction.

## Features

- **Data-driven Energy Consumption Prediction**: Predicts the energy consumption of 5G networks based on historical data and relevant network features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for model building.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and other regression models for accurate predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses performance metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations such as feature importance plots, prediction graphs, and data correlation matrices using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Provides insights into how factors like network load, base station configurations, and traffic affect energy consumption.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and preprocessing.
  - **LightGBM** and **XGBoost**: For building gradient boosting models to predict energy consumption.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and generating plots.
  - **Google Colab**: Cloud-based platform for running the notebook, with easy access to datasets via Google Drive.
  - **SciPy**: For statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets, which are assumed to be available on your **Google Drive**:

1. **Power Consumption Data (`power_consumption_prediction.csv`)**:
   - This dataset contains historical data related to power consumption, which will be the target variable for prediction.

2. **Base Station Data (`BSinfo.csv`)**:
   - Information about the base stations, such as geographical location, type, and energy usage metrics.

3. **CL Data (`CLdata.csv`)**:
   - Contains data related to traffic load, which directly affects the energy consumption of the network.

4. **Energy Consumption Data (`ECdata.csv`)**:
   - Historical data with energy consumption values for 5G networks, which will be used for training the model.

5. **Sample Submission (`SampleSubmission.csv`)**:
   - Used for submitting the predictions in the required format.

The notebook assumes that these datasets are stored on **Google Drive**, which is mounted for easy access in the Colab environment.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the instructions below to set up and run this project locally or in Google Colab.

### Google Colab Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine (if necessary).
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.

   ```bash
   https://colab.research.google.com/
   ```

3. Mount Google Drive to access the datasets stored there:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

4. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn lightgbm xgboost
   ```

5. Load the datasets from Google Drive into your Colab notebook using Pandas:

   ```python
   pcp_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/colab/power_consumption_prediction.csv")
   cl_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/colab/CLdata.csv")
   bs_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/colab/BSinfo.csv")
   ec_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/colab/ECdata.csv")
   ss_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/colab/SampleSubmission.csv")
   ```

6. After setting up, follow the notebook's steps to load, explore, preprocess, and analyze the data, followed by training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The notebook begins by loading and inspecting the datasets:

- **Dataset Inspection**: Display the shapes of the datasets and inspect the first few rows of each dataset.
  
  Example:

  ```python
  pcp_df.shape, cl_df.shape, bs_df.shape, ec_df.shape, ss_df.shape
  ```

- **Missing Data Handling**: Handle missing or null values, if present, through imputation or removal.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might help in predicting energy consumption, such as aggregating traffic load or base station data.
- **Data Normalization/Scaling**: Normalize or scale the data where necessary to ensure that the features are on a similar scale for modeling.

## Modeling

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Several models are evaluated, including **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and other regression algorithms such as **Random Forest** or **Linear Regression**.
   
   Example (XGBoost model training):

   ```python
   model = xgb.XGBRegressor()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Grid Search or Randomized Search is used to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use appropriate metrics such as **R-squared**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to evaluate model performance.
   - Cross-validation is employed to ensure robustness.

## Results and Evaluation

1. **Visualization**: The performance of the model is visualized through plots such as:
   - Feature importance plots to show which features are contributing most to the predictions.
   - Predicted vs. Actual plots to compare the model's predictions with actual energy consumption values.
   
   Example of plotting feature importance:

   ```python
   xgb.plot_importance(model)
   ```

2. **Model Comparison**: Compare multiple models and select the one that performs best based on the evaluation metrics.

3. **Prediction**: The final trained model is used to predict energy consumption for new data points (e.g., from the `SampleSubmission.csv`).
